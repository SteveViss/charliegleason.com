When [Ceres'](http://weareceres.com/) released their album **Drag It Down On You**, they didn't include lyrics. After a bunch of fans got in touch asking for them, we decided to build a time sensitive experiment.

Hand written lyrics for each song would be available for 24 hours, in an easily navigable mobile-first environment, and then they would be gone.

It was a huge success. Also, the album is amazing, so you should go get it.
