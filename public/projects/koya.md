*Kōya* is the debut album from Melbourne-based musician [Braille Face](https://brailleface.bandcamp.com/).

I was approached by [Spirit Level](http://spiritlevel.com/) to help out with the interface for an interactive artwork in the browser. Using WebGL and your webcam, if available, *Kōya* generates an unique environment that changes with every track.

Powered by Ian MacLarty's audio visual toolkit [Amulet](http://amulet.xyz), and React's [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), *Kōya* encourages the viewer to literally reach out and interact with the space around them. Inspired by the original artwork by Max Löffler, it's an immersive piece of art that showcases the incredible power of the web.
